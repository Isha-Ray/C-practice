/* What are Operators in C?
Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values.
For example: +, -, *, /, = are all operators. */

/* Types of Operators in C ----

Type	                        Description	                            Example

1. Arithmetic Operators	        Mathematical calculations	            +, -, *, /, %
2. Relational Operators	        Comparison between values	            ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
3. Logical Operators	        Logical conditions	                    && (AND), `
4. Assignment Operators	        Assign values	                        =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
5. Increment/Decrement	        Increase/decrease by 1	                ++, --
6. Bitwise Operators	        Bit-level operations	                &, `
7. Conditional (Ternary)	    Shortcut for if-else	                (condition) ? true : false
8. Comma Operator	            Evaluates multiple expressions	         a = (b=5, b+10);
9. Sizeof Operator	            Returns size of a data type	             sizeof(int)

/* Types of Instructions in C -----

Type	                            Meaning	                                        Example
1. Type Declaration             Instruction	Declares variables	                int a, b;
2. Arithmetic Instruction	    Mathematical operations	                        c = a + b;
3. Control Instruction	        Controls flow of program	                    if, else, while, for, etc.

/* Type Conversion -----
Type conversion means changing one data type to another.

Implicit: Compiler apne aap change kare(e.g., int to float).
Explicit: Programmer khud type change kare using (type).

/* Operator Precedence and Associativity ---------

Operator Precedence:
It decides which operator is evaluated first when there are multiple operators.

Operator Associativity:
If same precedence, then associativity decides left to right or right to left evaluation. 

*/

/* Decision Control Statements -----------
These are used to make decisions in the program.

Statement	                            Description	                                            Example
if	                                Checks one condition	                                    if (a > b)
if-else	                            Two-way decision	                                        if (a > b) else
else-if ladder	                    Multiple conditions	                                        if ... else if ... else
nested if	                        if inside another if	                                    if (a > 0) { if (a < 10) }
switch	                            Many fixed cases	                                        switch (choice) { case 1: ... }

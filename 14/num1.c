/*1. Flowchart

A pictorial representation of an algorithm or logic using symbols.

Common symbols:

Oval → Start/End
Rectangle → Process
Diamond → Decision
Arrow → Flow direction

Example: Flowchart to add 2 numbers


[Start] → [Input A, B] → [Sum = A + B] → [Print Sum] → [End]

*/



/* 2. Flowchart for Loop

Example: While Loop (Print 1 to N)

[Start] → [i=1] → ┌─> [i <= N ?] ─Yes─> [Print i] → [i=i+1] ─┐
                   │                                         │
                   └── No <----------------------------------┘
                           ↓
                         [End]

*/


/* 3. Algorithm

Step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.

Example: Algorithm to find largest number in an array

1. Start
2. Input size of array and elements
3. Assume first element is largest
4. Compare each element with current largest
5. Update largest if a bigger element is found
6. Print largest element
7. End

*/

/* 4. Characteristics of Algorithm

Finite (must terminate)
Definite (clear steps)
Input (zero or more)
Output (at least one result)
Effective (feasible, can be done)
Independent (language-independent)

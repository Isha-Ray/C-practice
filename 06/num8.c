What Are Storage Classes in C?

In C programming, storage classes define four main things about a variable:

Scope – Where the variable can be accessed.
Lifetime – How long the variable exists in memory.
Default value – If not initialized, what it contains.
Storage location – Whether it’s stored in memory or CPU registers.

/* 
What are Global and Local Variables in C?

Declared inside a function or block ({ })
Can be accessed only within that function/block
Created when the function is called, and destroyed when it ends
Default value: Garbage (if not initialized)

Global Variable:

Declared outside all functions (usually at the top)
Can be accessed by any function in the program
Exists throughout the entire program execution
Default value: 0 (if not initialized)
